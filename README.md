# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a
prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named
Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our
goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by
date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was
developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new
adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we
can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase
above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such its
Quality is 80 and it never alters.
